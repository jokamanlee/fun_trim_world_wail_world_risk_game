Creative Coding Final

2D shooter

Kirby

Cheese = Ultimate = Surprise Effect

(Might have to find a way to incorporate Tetris)

Wailing Globs


Start thinking please

You have Kirby who is the character that you are going to control

Make it an orange Kirby

Shooting at blobs and after you defeat them, they drop a piece of cheese and you can collect them

By collecting each cheese your ultimate bar charges


Make a pop up game when the ultimate bar reaches full where is is choose the right piece to fit in the slot like a multiple choice option 
If you get it right then ur ultimate goes through and it kills everything in front of what your facing like a big beam 


GOAL:
Keep fighting minions if you reach a certain time the small globs begin to merge and the big boss comes out and you have to defeat it to win

Extra:
I can put extra levels to make it harder
